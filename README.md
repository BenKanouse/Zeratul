Zeratul

### History 

Zeratul is one of the central characters in the StarCraft series. At six hundred and thirty-five years old (born in 1865 according to Matt Cohen) and holding the rank of prelate, Zeratul is a member of the Nerazim, better known as the Dark Templar, whose forebears were exiled from the Protoss homeworld of Aiur over a thousand years ago for refusing to submit to the Khala. A renowned psionic warrior and assassin, he is described by GameSpot as a "savior" and "willing scapegoat" for his people and ranked in their top ten heroes chart. During the later episodes he takes part in defeating the Overmind on Aiur and reuniting the Dark Templar with the rest of their people. Zeratul was voiced by Jack Ritschel in StarCraft and Brood War, and by Fred Tatasciore in StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty.

A somewhat secretive and calculating character, Zeratul is nevertheless a venerable and wise leader who is honorable and loyal to his species. He would gladly risk anything to safeguard Aiur. During the Great War, Zeratul allied with the Khalai Tassadar, despite his hatred for the Protoss Conclave that once banished his forebears. During the dire events leading up to the evacuation of Aiur, he also convinced the Khalai Protoss that his brethren, the Dark Templar, would be more welcoming of sheltering their estranged brethren in their lightless homeworld Shakuras in contrast to the consistently hostile attitudes of the Conclave towards his people. He knows that though he is scorned by the very same people who look to him for salvation, he is aware of what must be done to save the universe, and must still lead his people to salvation. He is also depicted as patient, tolerant and far-sighted: when Zeratul first met Tassadar, he refused to take offense even though he was attacked by the wary Protoss commander, even attempting to teach Tassadar the art of combat (while avoiding being struck). Eventually Zeratul overcame Tassadar's prejudice, beginning to heal the rifts between the Khalai and the Dark Templar. The two leaders (and Jim Raynor) came to an understanding, joined forces and hid from the Zerg. He often speaks in riddles, preferring that others come up with the answers to the questions he puts forward rather than answering them himself.
